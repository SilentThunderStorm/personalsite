    	  <p>
    	    I''m a front end coder. I take pride in writing beautiful code.
    	  </p>
    	  <p>
    	    My prefered language is absolutely pure JavaScript, although I am also perfectly comfortable coding in jQuery or TypeScript. I am also completely comfortable handling HTML5, CSS3, and even handle some of the backend coding through PHP, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. I have handled Ajax, Web Sockets, Web Workers, Canvas, SVG, and several other of the new, upcoming web technologies.
    	  </p>
    	  <p>
    	    I have done front end coding for about 3 years now, and have been a solitary coder the entire time. This means that most of the work that I have done has been on smaller projects, and I am looking forward to working on larger scale projects as a valued member of a team.

    	    <img src="img/logo.svg" class="text right small" alt="sirah inc. logo">My most recent project has been working on <a href="http://gonetworkstl.com" target="offsite">GO! Network's site</a> which is backed by WordPress. My duties here included helping them slim down and reorganize the site, as well as adding some jQuery for various sections of their site. I did this as an independent contractor under the name 'sirah inc.', my logo is on the right. 
    	  </p>
    	  <p>I also worked for <a href="http://worknetnow.com" target="offsite">Worknet Inc.</a> creating a client database. I did this using the web technologies of PHP, PostgreSQL, HTML5, and CSS3 because they needed to retain a single database, even if they opened remote satelite offices; this allowed them to easily export the entire database to an external server.
    	  </p>
    	  <p>
    	    While I do have skills and experience, all of this experience has been as a solo developer. This has limited my growth as a coder, and I am hoping to move forward as a valued member of a team. I would love to learn the development process on larger projects, and to be able to work with other coders to make something beautiful!

          My Skillset
        </h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
          I hand-build responsive websites from scratch. All of the pages on this site were hand built. I have worked in professional tools ranging from Notepad++ to <a href="http://c9.io">Cloud9 IDE</a> (my primary IDE) as well as more standard toolsets such as Eclipse, NetBeans, and even VisualStudio. 
        </p>
        <p><img src="img/hand-coded.jpg" class="text fancy" alt="Coding by hand still requires a computer; it doesn't actually mean BY HAND.">Specifically, these pages were written using <a href="http://c9.io" target="offsite">Cloud9 IDE</a>, were tested by hand, and were checked in Internet Explorer 10, and the current releases of both Chrome and FireFox. The code is held in a repository on <a href="https://github.com/SilentThunderStorm/personalsite.git" target="offsite">GitHub</a>, and was deployed directly from the IDE. The code which is reaching your browser has been compiled; feel free to check out my <a href="https://github.com/SilentThunderStorm/personalsite.git" target="offsite">source code</a>.
        </p>
        <p>I generally build my own testing code from scrath, but have worked with testing frameworks such as JUnit and others. Typically, I use a combination of hand-written test cases and the in-browser JavaScript console (using each browser) to determine script performance bottlenecks and other issues, and to troubleshoot my code.</p>
        <p>
          I specialize in understanding the languages that I work with, rather than relying on a library to do the heavy lifting. This ensures that in cases where the library is unavailable, or is seen to be less efficient, I am still at full strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am, however, fully comfortable with several libraries, including jQuery. The pages on this site were all coded without using any external libraries, unless a specific library was required to demonstrate sufficient skill; for example, my sample code using jQuery is clearly labeled as such.

        <h1>What I am looking for</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
          <strong>I want to work as a member of a team</strong>. I want to understand the development process and to work with other coders. Exposure to a team environment will allow me to learn best practices, as well as allow to me to work on much more significant projects than I am currently able to.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="img/web-development.jpg" class="text fancy right" alt="jumbled list of web coding technologies">In my current situation, I feel that my growth as a developer is being significantly limited by the fact that i am working solo, as well as by the fact that the company for which I am currently working can provide no room for growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to push my skills to their limit, and would love to move from developing web page to developing we <strong>applications</strong>. I am fully capable of learning, and wold love the opportunity to add additional technologies to my repertoire. Specifically, much of my knowledge is on the front end, to build real web applications, I would love to learn more about handling fast, scalable back end code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specific areas for growth include the .Net languages, Java, Node.js, Python and Ruby as well as scalable libraries and frameworks.
